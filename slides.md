# Jobs that Does not exists yet

- Calculator/Computer was an actual job title.
- Youtuber/Influencer does not exist 20 years ago.
- DevOp was not even a word 20 years ago. 
- Some will keep getting renamed with the same underlying skill set.
  - Operation Research → Financial Engineer → Data Scientist → Some other fancy names
  - DBA → Data Engineer → ML Engineer → AI Engineer -> ...

# What we really learn?

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-auto-rows: auto; gap: 10px;">
  <div v-click class="element">
  
  ## Fearless of the unknown
  - We approach really difficult problems on a daily basis.
  - We learn to live with the feeling of being stupid or lost.
  
  </div>
  <div v-click class="element">
    
  ## Spotting patterns and correlations
  - Gather all the fundamental laws to solve problems.
  - Formulate fundamental mechanisms from the patterns we find.
  
  </div>
  <div v-click class="element">

  ## Quantitative reasoning
  - Call it what you want: Math, Statistics, Data Science, etc.
  - Formulate problems in quantitative ways.
  
  </div>
  <div v-click class="element">

  ## Communication skills
  - Teaching your friends the homework.
  - Asking the right questions.
  - In fact, a large part of managerial work is communication.

# Our Very Unique Offer: First Principle approach.

- Rich People
  - Problem? → Money → Fix
- Other People
  - Problem? → Look up known solution → Fix.
- First Principle's Approach
  - Problem? → Look up known solution/Figure out the underlying mechanism → Fix
  - Bonus: Figure out the underlying mechanism → Abusable.

# Science Major
- Among the best in the industry at solving unknown problems.
- Most problems in the industry are not by the book, even if they aren't cutting-edge.
  - When was the last time you saw a spherical conductor?
  - New constraints, modified objectives, etc.
- We are permanently wired to think this way.
  - Once a scientist, always a scientist.

# Does the industry know this?
Yes, they do. Sort of.

  ## Be Open
  - Academia isn't the only path. Even in academia, changing field is OK.
  - There is nothing wrong with job not directly related to your degree.

  </div>

  <div v-click class="element">

  ## Job Listing
  - Most don't list physics as the major they want. But, apply anyway if you seem to be able to contribute.
  - Most people that hire physicists are either physicists themselves or word of mouth.

  </div>

  <div v-click class="element">

  ## Present yourself
  - Yes you feel stupid all the time. But, you are not stupid.
  - Show it in your Resume/CV/Interview that you have unique offer.
  - Be smart but not smartass.

  </div>

  <div v-click class="element">

  ## Communication is key
  - Emphathy.
  - Your know something that they don't.
  - They don't know something you do.
  - You still need to be able to explain to them to get them up on the same speed/buy your argument.

# Late night during the covid pandemic
- RT-PCR were quite expensive early on. 
- Positive proportion was typically very low. Most were gonna be negative.
- Pooling (put multiple people in the same tube) might save costs.
  - If anyone in the pool is positive, the tube is positive, and we will retest them individually.
  - If the tube is negative, everyone is negative.
- How many people should we put in a tube?

# Looking at myself.
- Problem involves PCR. He is not a biologist.
- PCR has test tubes and a bunch of chemicals. He is not a chemist.
- It has to do with probability. He is not a statistician.
- It has to do with optimization. He is not a mathematician.
- How many of this combo are there? 
  - Biologist+Chemist+Statistician+Mathematician
- But we can solve the problem.
  - With our first principle approach.

# Real problems are interdisciplinary.

$\int^1_0 x^2 dx$

Solve the Schrödinger equation for infinite square well.

But you can still do it if you want to.

# Tire Reliability Problem 🚛🛞

- Suppose you work at a logistics company. 📦
- Feels like you're spending too much on tires. 💸
- What do you do? 🤔
  - Spend more money to solve the problem? → Vendor says so. 🛍️
- You have a set of data (pressure, tire life). Can you "predict" the lifetime of a tire given its pressure/brand? 🔮📊
  - Match it with a known problem → Regression. 📈
  - Actually understand the problem → It's a random process. 🎲
- What if the tire runs at different pressures all the time? 🤷‍♂️

# Hard Truth
<v-clicks>

- Degree name != Skill set name
  - If we change our major name to Quantitative Analysis with concentration in Fundamental Laws of Nature, we would have less questions.
  - I got asked by executive every 2 years to change the program name to something more "applied".
- Everyone will need to learn the new environment anyway.
  - PCR Pooling problem. Anyone trained specifically to solve this?
  - We did things in hard mode. (And we love feeling stupid all the time).
  - Learning typically takes less time. And we typically have a deeper understanding at the end.
- Quick Learner vs One Trick Specialist
  - Given rapidly changing world, the choice is clear.
- The quantitative analysis skill will be needed for a foreseeable future.
  - Skills for using specific tools or performing specific tasks do not age well.

# Stuff that complements your science degree in non-academia world.

::left::

- ## Adapt or Die.
  - If we don't disrupt ourselves, someone else will.
- ## Programming.
  - Most real world problem are not grounded spherical conductor.
  - Get the computer to do it for you. (In general be lazy and use technology to your advantage)
- ## English.
  - Most of human knowledge are transferred/kept in this language. If you are locked in Thai, you are screwed.

::right::

- ## Teaching and Communication to non-scientists.
  - Our problem set are typically individual work.
  - Real world you work as a team with people of different skills.
- ## How business world operates.
  - Try starting a business(online shop etc.), tutoring for money etc.
