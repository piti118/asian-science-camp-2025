# What we really learn?

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-auto-rows: auto; gap: 10px;">
  <div v-click class="element">
  
  ## Fearless of the unknown
  - We approach really difficult problems on a daily basis.
  - We learn to live with the feeling of being stupid or lost.
  
  </div>
  <div v-click class="element">
    
  ## Spotting patterns and correlations
  - Gather all the fundamental laws to solve problems.
  - Formulate fundamental mechanisms from the patterns we find.
  
  </div>
  <div v-click class="element">

  ## Quantitative reasoning
  - Call it what you want: Math, Statistics, Data Science, etc.
  - Formulate problems in quantitative ways.
  
  </div>
  <div v-click class="element">

  ## Communication skills
  - Teaching your friends the homework.
  - Asking the right questions.
  - In fact, a large part of managerial work is communication.

# Science Major
- Among the best in the industry at solving unknown problems.
- Most problems in the industry are not by the book, even if they aren't cutting-edge.
  - When was the last time you saw a spherical conductor?
  - New constraints, modified objectives, etc.
- We are permanently wired to think this way.
  - Once a scientist, always a scientist.

# Does the industry know this?

  ## Be Open
  - Academia isn't the only path. Even in academia, changing field is OK.
  - There is nothing wrong with job not directly related to your degree.

  ## Job Listing
  - Most don't list physics as the major they want. But, apply anyway if you seem to be able to contribute.
  - Most people that hire physicists are either physicists themselves or word of mouth.

  ## Communication is key
  - Emphathy.
  - Your know something that they don't.

# Late night during the covid pandemic
- RT-PCR were quite expensive early on. 
- Positive proportion was typically very low. Most were gonna be negative.
- Pooling (put multiple people in the same tube) might save costs.
  - If anyone in the pool is positive, the tube is positive, and we will retest them individually.
  - If the tube is negative, everyone is negative.
- How many people should we put in a tube?

# Looking at myself.
- Problem involves PCR. He is not a biologist.
- PCR has test tubes and a bunch of chemicals. He is not a chemist.
- It has to do with probability. He is not a statistician.
- It has to do with optimization. He is not a mathematician.
- How many of this combo are there? 
  - Biologist+Chemist+Statistician+Mathematician
- But we can solve the problem.
  - With our first principle approach.

# It's not that hard.
- $n$ people in total.
- Each tube has $m$ samples.
- Each person has probability $p$ of being positive.
- We know that the major effect has to do with these three numbers.

---

# Let us reason

$$ {0|1|2|3|4|none}
\begin{align*}
PCR &= \frac{n}{m} + m \times \text{\# group positive} \\
E[PCR] &= E \left[ \frac{n}{m} \right] + m \times E\left[ \text{\# of group positive} \right]\\
&= \frac{n}{m} + m \times E\left[ \text{\# of group positive} \right] \\
&=  \frac{n}{m} + \underbrace{n \times (1- (1-p)^m)}_{n \times (1-P(\text{everyone negative}))} \\
\end{align*}
$$


<div v-click v-mark.circle.green>

$$
E[PCR] = \frac{n}{m} + n \times (1- (1-p)^m)

$$
E[PCR] = \frac{n}{m} + n \times (1- (1-p)^m)
$$
This means all we need is to minimize this with respect to $m$.
$$
\frac{d}{dm}E[PCR] = 0
$$
Well differentiate exponential is quite annoying. Hello Taylor series.
$$
E[PCR] \approx \frac{n}{m} + n \times (1- (1-mp))
$$
$$
\frac{d}{dm}E[PCR] = -\frac{n}{m^2} + n \times p = 0
$$
$$
m = \sqrt{\frac{1}{p}}

# Real problems are interdisciplinary.
## Understand then Abuse skill is generalizable.

$\int^1_0 x^2 dx$

Solve the Schrödinger equation for infinite square well.

But you can still do it if you want to.
You may not feel comfortable. I blame textbooks.

# Tire Reliability Problem 🚛🛞

- Suppose you work at a logistics company. 📦
- Feels like you're spending too much on tires. 💸

<v-click>

- What do you do? 🤔
  - Spend more money to solve the problem? → Vendor says so. 🛍️
- You have a set of data (pressure, tire life). Can you "predict" the lifetime of a tire given its pressure/brand? 🔮📊
  - Match it with a known problem → Regression. 📈
  - Actually understand the problem → It's a random process. 🎲
- What if the tire runs at different pressures all the time? 🤷‍♂️

  ### Everyone Relearns
  
  - PCR Pooling problem. Anyone trained specifically to solve this?
  - We did things in hard mode. (And we love feeling stupid all the time).

# Stuff that complements your science degree in non-academia world.

::left::
<v-clicks>

- ## Adapt or Die.
  - Expand your horizon, just in case.
  - If we don't disrupt ourselves, someone else will.
- ## Programming.
  - Most real-world problems are not grounded spherical conductors.
  - Get the computer to do it for you. (In general, be lazy and use technology to your advantage.)
- ## English.
  - Most human knowledge is transferred/kept in this language. If you are locked in Thai, you are at a disadvantage.

<v-clicks>

- ## Teaching and Communication to Non-Scientists.
  - Our problem sets are typically individual work.
  - In the real world, you work as a team with people of different skills.
- ## How the Business World Operates.
  - Try starting a business (online shop, etc.), tutoring for money, etc.
  - Put more context on the problem.
