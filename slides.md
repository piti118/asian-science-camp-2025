# Non-Academic Jobs
- Huge Market. Competition for our "skill set" is relatively low.
  - Finance, Data Scientist, Engineer, Quality Control, Insurance, IT, Marketing, Business Analyst, SME Owner, HR, Business Consult, High School Teacher, Health Care, Military etc.
- Still get to do cool stuff. Might not be so cutting edge.
- Higher pay.
- You get to pick the location.
- Some hurdles that you need to get through.
- It's actually the true mainstream. Most of you will do this.

# Jobs that Does not exists yet
- Calculator/Computer was an actual job title.
- Youtuber/Influencer does not exist 20 years ago.
- DevOp was not even a word 20 years ago. 

- Some will keep getting renamed with the same underlying skill set.
  - Operation Research ‚Üí Financial Engineer ‚Üí Data Scientist ‚Üí Some other fancy names
  - DBA ‚Üí Data Engineer ‚Üí ML Engineer ‚Üí AI Engineer -> ...

# What did we do/learn
- Problem sets
- Lab Reports
- Presentations

---
layout: full

# What we really learn?
- Fearless to the unknown.
  - We approach really difficult problems on daily basis.
  - We learn to live with the feeling of being stupid/lost.
- Spotting Patterns and Correlations
  - Gather around all the fundamental laws to solve the problems.
  - We formulate fundamental mechanism from the patterns we found.
- Quantitative reasoning
  - Call it what you want: Math, Statistics, Data Science, etc.
  - Formulate problem in quantitative ways.
- Communication skills
  - Teaching your friend on the homework.
  - Asking the right questions.
  - In fact, large part of managerial work is communication.

# Our Very Unique Offer: First Principle approach.

- Rich People
  - Problem? ‚Üí Money ‚Üí Fix
- Other People
  - Problem? ‚Üí Look up known solution ‚Üí Fix.
- Physicist's Approach
  - Problem? ‚Üí Look up known solution/Figure out the underlying mechanism ‚Üí Fix
  - Bonus: Figure out the underlying mechanism ‚Üí Abusable.
- Among the best in the industry in solving the unknown problem.
- Most of the problem in the industry is not by the book even if it's not cutting edge.
  - Last time your see spherical conductor?
  - New constraint etc. Modified objective etc.
- We are permanently wired to think this way.
  - Once a scientist, always a scientist.

# Adjustment
- Be Open
  - Academia isn't the only path. Even in academia, changing field is OK.
  - There is nothing wrong with job not directly related to your degree.
- Job Listing
  - Most don't list physics as the major they want. But, apply anyway if you seem to be able to contribute.
  - Most people that hire physicists are either physicists themselves or word of mouth.
- Learn how to present yourself
  - Yes you feel stupid all the time. But, you are not stupid.
  - Show it in your Resume/CV/Interview that you have unique offer.
  - Be smart but not smartass. Eg. Sheldon Cooper.
- Communication is key
  - Jack of all trades, master of most of them.
  - Yes, you are probably gonna be smarter than most of your colleagues.
  - Don't brush them off as lower intelligence. They possess some other skills you don't.
  - You still need to be able to explain to them to get them up on the same speed/buy your argument.

# Did we waste time with a hard science degree?
Why not just study a more "direct" major?

# But I thought that XXX job is for YYY major?

- ## Jobs require skills not degree. üõ†Ô∏èüéì
  - Some do require degree by law. Ex: Doctor. ‚öñÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è
- ## As an employer, we hire people for their skills not degree.

# Secret
## There is no real "direct major".

# Late night during the covid pandemic
- RT-PCR are quite expensive. 
- Positive proportion is typically very low. Most are gonna be negative.
- Pooling (put multiple people in the same tube) might save costs.
  - If any one in the pool is positive, the tube and positive and we will retest them individually.
  - If the tube is negative, everyone is negative.
- How many people should we put in a tube?
- Question was asked around 10pm‚Ä¶
- Anyone trained to answer this?

# Well...
- Problem involves PCR. He is not a biologist.
- PCR has test tubes and a bunch of chemicals. He is not a chemist.
- It has to do with probability. He is not a statistician.
- It has to do with optimization. He is not a mathematician.
- How many of this combo are there? 
  - Biologist+Chemist+Statistician+Mathematician
- But we can solve the problem.
  - With our first principle approach.

# Real problems are interdisciplinary.
## Understand then Abuse skill is generalizable.

$\int^1_0 x^2 dx$

Solve the Schr√∂dinger equation for infinite square well.

But you can still do it if you want to.

# Tire Reliability Problem

- Suppose you work at a logistic company.
- Felt like you spent too much on tires.
- What do you do?
- Spend more money to solve problem. ‚Üí  Vendor Said so
- You have a set of (pressure, tire life). Can you "predict" life time for a tire with given pressure/brand?
- Match it with a known problem ‚Üí  Regression
- Actually Understand the Problem ‚Üí  It's a random process.
- What if the tire runs at different pressure all the time?

# Why not a direct major?
- Degree name != Skill set name
  - If we change our major name to Quantitative Analysis with concentration in Fundamental Laws of Nature, we would have less questions.
  - I got asked by executive every 2 years to change the program name to something more "applied".
- Everyone will need to learn the new environment anyway.
  - PCR Pooling problem. Anyone trained specifically to solve this?
  - We did things in hard mode. (And we love feeling stupid all the time).
  - Learning typically takes less time. And we typically have a deeper understanding at the end.
- Quick Learner vs Specialist
  - The person who can solve wide range of problem with some learning curve. 
  - Or the person who knows solve specific problem by the book quickly.
  - Given rapidly changing world, the choice is clear.
- The quantitative analysis skill will be needed for a foreseeable future.
- Skills for using specific tools or performing specific tasks do not age well.

# So many choices what program should I choose?

- All choices are bad actually. üò¨
- All choices are also good. üëç
- Curriculum can only play catch up. Trend goes toward
  - Analytic üìä
  - Programming/Automation ü§ñ
  - Communication üó£Ô∏è

# Stuff that complements your science degree in non-academia world.

- ## Adapt or Die.
  - If we don't disrupt ourselves, someone else will.
- ## Programming.
  - Most real world problem are not grounded spherical conductor.
  - Get the computer to do it for you. (In general be lazy and use technology to your advantage)
- ## English.
- Most of human knowledge are transferred/kept in this language. If you are locked in Thai, you are screwed.
- ## Teaching and Communication to non-scientists.
  - Our problem set are typically individual work.
  - Real world you work as a team with people of different skills.
- ## How business world operates.
  - Try starting a business(online shop etc.), tutoring for money etc.
